      🧠 Instructional Design & Pedagogical Best Practices
    </div>
    <div class="strengths">
      <p><strong>✅ Highlights of the Design</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Teacher provides a clear learning sequence</strong> that builds from activating prior knowledge, to recognizing digital threats, to practicing strategies, and finally applying them through interactive activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain speech is used expertly</strong> by The Teacher to explain complex topics to The Students—like SQL injection—in ways that are clear, accurate, and approachable without oversimplifying.</li>
        <li><strong>The lessons are thoughtfully organized</strong> into manageable chunks that follow consistent themes and design patterns, helping The Students know what to expect as they move through the material.</li>
        <li><strong>Built-in self-checks</strong> allow The Students to test their understanding at their own pace in a safe, judgment-free way.</li>
        <li><strong>The Students are given choices</strong> throughout the experience—such as working independently or teaming up, decorating their work, or contributing to a shared class activity—making the lesson more enjoyable and engaging.</li>
      </ul>

      🌈 Neurodiversity & Cognitive Support
    </div>
    <div class="strengths">
      <p><strong>✅ Highlights of the Design</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The layout is predictable and visually supportive,</strong> using icons and color patterns to reduce visual overload and support attention and memory.</li>
        <li><strong>The Students are encouraged to explore content on their own terms,</strong> which supports learners with different attention spans and planning styles.</li>
        <li><strong>The tone of the lesson is friendly and relatable</strong>—with analogies like seatbelts and online villains—that connect with teenagers without talking down to them.</li>
        <li><strong>The Teacher uses repeated icons and metaphors</strong> to help The Students remember key ideas without overwhelming them with information.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="strengths">
      <p><strong>✅ What The Teacher Is Doing Well</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Color contrast</strong> is strong and clear, making content easy to read for The Students with vision differences.</li>
        <li><strong>All navigation is keyboard-friendly</strong> and works for assistive technology like screen readers.</li>
        <li><strong>Headings and content structures</strong> are properly labeled so that the lesson is organized and readable on many devices and formats.</li>
        <li><strong>The Teacher uses minimal images and relies on emoji cues,</strong> which keeps the page accessible even on slow internet or for students with limited vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Invisible layout aids</strong> like spacing rows use proper HTML accessibility tags.</li>

      ⏩ Pacing & Personalized Support
    </div>
    <div class="strengths">
      <p><strong>✅ What’s Working Well</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Students can learn at their own pace</strong>—they’re never rushed and can revisit lessons, quizzes, and activities whenever they need to.</li>
        <li><strong>Opportunities for social learning are built-in</strong>—such as optional peer check-ins or team-up tasks—but these are never required. Solo learners are equally supported.</li>
        <li><strong>The Teacher is free to focus on meaningful check-ins</strong> and conversations with students rather than grading every detail or delivering all instruction live.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive scenarios</strong> help The Students practice decision-making and apply what they’ve learned in real-life contexts.</li>

      🍎 Teacher Empowerment & Equity
    </div>
    <div class="strengths">
      <p><strong>✅ Strong Educational Practice</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Teacher automates much of the daily routine</strong>—including grouping, practice activities, and comprehension checks—so time can be spent helping individual students.</li>
        <li><strong>The Teacher acts more like a coach than a manager,</strong> offering encouragement and personalized support to The Students who need it most.</li>
        <li><strong>The Students create shareable work</strong> that contributes to the class culture—like digital cards or reflections—which builds community and honors their voices.</li>
